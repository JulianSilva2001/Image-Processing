## SIFT Feature Matching

This experiment demonstrates the use of the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for feature matching between two images. The process involves detecting and describing keypoints, and then matching these keypoints between the images.

### Process

1. **Image Loading**: Two images are loaded, which you want to match. One is the main image, and the other is the template.

2. **SIFT Initialization**: The SIFT detector is initialized. SIFT is a robust algorithm for detecting and describing local features in images.

3. **Keypoint Detection**: Keypoints and descriptors are detected in both images. Keypoints are unique, identifiable points in the image, and descriptors are vectors that describe the region around each keypoint.

4. **Keypoint Matching**: A FLANN-based matcher is used to match the keypoints between the two images. FLANN is a fast library for approximate nearest neighbor searches.

5. **Ratio Test**: Lowe's ratio test is applied to filter out good matches. This test helps in retaining only those matches that are significantly better than the others.

6. **Visualization**: The good matches are visualized by drawing lines between corresponding keypoints in the two images.

By using SIFT and FLANN, this experiment effectively identifies and matches key features in the images, demonstrating the power of feature-based image analysis.
